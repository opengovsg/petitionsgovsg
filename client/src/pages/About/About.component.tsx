            The time taken by a ministry to review and consider your petition
            once they receive it can vary. The ministry may reach out to the
            petitioner, endorsers, or other relevant organisations to request
            more information regarding a petition.

            relevant ministry for a response. If you would like your cause to be
            presented to Parliament, you can approach a Member of Parliament
            separately to sponsor and submit a written petition.
